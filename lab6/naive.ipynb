( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf\\ndear shareholder , addlrko\\ni am writing to you today to\\ndiscuss the new direction which your company will be\\nheading . up until this point we made it clear that\\nabdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of\\nthe market . our basic premise was to seek out\\ncompanies that can be turned into positive cash flow\\nbusinesses with the proper equity investment made into\\nthem by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;\\nwith a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we\\nexpect fine wein to be able to throw off significant\\npositive cash flow over the next 12 months from the\\nvarious projects they are currently working on .\\ne - direct is another example ; we should start to see\\nsome meaningful positive cash flow developing and\\ncontinuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has\\nnot maintained a particular industry focus . as of\\ntoday that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir\\nlast week we announced that abdv\\nwill be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to\\nfuture quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,\\na company in the oil gas sector , this was the start\\nof our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in\\nlocating and provide managerial , accounting and\\nfinancing for companies in the energy field , from oil\\nand gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft\\nyou may ask ; why the energy\\nrelated field ? simply it currently offers many\\nopportunities and with the price of oil approaching\\n$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth\\nto be made in this sector . according to adjusted\\ninflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak\\nof $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis\\nof the past , we are looking at what will be a problem\\nto stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand\\nfor oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this\\nyear alone , most of which is because of china . the\\nincrease in oil prices is not a fade which once the\\nbubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30\\nlevel . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented\\nin stone . there are more players in the world economy\\ntoday that require oil gas to propel their own\\neconomies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at\\nthese higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself\\nwith individuals that have experience in the energy\\nfield . these individuals will help locate viable\\nopportunities and the funding necessary to participate\\nin these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira\\nso what do we do with our\\nnon - energy related businesses such as fine wein\\nrecords and e - direct ? well , first of all we will\\ncontinue to incubate and nurture these businesses\\nuntil they are at a level where they can move on their\\nown . i believe that both of these companies will be\\nstrong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at\\nthat point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of\\ndirectors that we spin - off these two businesses to our\\nshareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the\\nbasic premise of our business module whereby we share\\nthe wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing\\npublic our portfolio companies . we can then continue\\nto concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw\\nby concentrating on a specific\\nsector such as the energy area we will be able to\\ndefine abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our\\ngoal will be to locate and make investments in no less\\nthan four energy - related businesses over the next 12\\nmonths . i believe that by maintaining this focus an\\ninvestment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative\\nway to participate in the booming oil gas and\\nenergy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm\\nfine wein records , inc .\\nannounces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo\\nfine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development\\ncorporation , inc .

promoted , making a very large number of\\ninvestors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp\\nlet ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp .\\notc : dmxpp\\nabout the company : p\\ndelta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration\\ncompany that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres\\n( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all\\nlocated over what management considers to be some of the most\\nprospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .\\nanother 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are\\ncontrolled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed\\nthat the bolivian properties display similar potential to those\\nfound in north america . p\\nthe management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry\\nrayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration\\ncompany to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of\\nexperience in the field of geology , along with running some of the\\nmost successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was\\nthe president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a\\nmarket cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated\\nwith glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp\\nminerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector\\nalong with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an\\nextraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company\\nmoves forward . p\\namong the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30\\nyears experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,\\nsouth america and the united states . while with gold fields mining\\ncorp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent\\ndrilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p\\ndelta has experienced significant technical success since its\\nstart - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first\\nin - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead\\nkimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part\\nof the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown\\nthe three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator\\nminerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic\\ndiamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p\\nan aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to\\ndiscover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this\\nunder - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing\\nkimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p\\nin bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly\\nprospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia\\ngroup of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other\\none - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to\\nthe independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres\\ncomprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays\\nall the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further\\nexploration is justified . p\\ndelta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing\\nits extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also\\nby acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on\\nidentifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining\\ncompanies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and\\nfinance additional exploration . p\\nin addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta\\ncontrols , they also control a gold property with great potential .\\nthe property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis\\nrevealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an\\nextensive exploration program . pp\\n( source : company

the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy ,\\nan industry with such high global demand that it is impossible\\nto assign a value to the size of the market .\\ngeec is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their\\nbiosphere process system for the disposal of a wide variety\\nof waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour , making a major\\nimpact on the global waste problem . this profitable and\\nenvironmentally safe process converts into clean , green\\nelectricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste ,\\nagricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes ,\\nindustrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural\\ngas , and the huge market of used tires .\\ngeec generates 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity\\nfrom the waste conversion on a continuous basis which is\\nthen sold to replenish the local or national grid .\\nthe biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide\\nneed for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a\\ncorresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the\\ndisposal of waste . geec has secured international acceptance\\nfor a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact\\nthe global waste problem while a major push for generating\\nelectricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot\\ntopic due to shortages and massive power failures .\\ngeec just announced a $ 10 billion , 5 - year joint venture with\\nchinese government - operated companies , including yanzhou coal\\nmining ( nyse - yzc , $ 74 ) . the deal is structured to have 1 , 300\\ngeec biosphere systems deployed throughout china to fulfill\\nan urgent need for waste disposal and energy generation , two\\ncritical areas for a country with a population exceeding 1 . 3\\nbillion people . as china ' s rapid economic advance continues ,\\na shortfall of 500 million kilowatts exists annually , prompting\\nperiodic blackouts in all chinese provinces . geec is in line\\nto profit substantially while providing relief from unmanageable\\nmunicpal solid waste disposal and simultaneously helping china\\nmeet its energy needs .\\nthe forecast for geec is crystal clear , and this is just the tip\\nof the iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares\\nshould be added immediately to every portfolio . we expect a\\ncontinuous flow of huge news announcements while shares still\\nrepresent an uncommon value for a company of this caliber . look\\nfor the continuation of strong positive developments that will\\nignite geec , which earns our highest rating for the

( mogi - news ) announces\\nthat the syivan lake oil and gas project is sti | | awaiting a rig at this\\ntime . the surface lease has been constructed and we have\\nbeen waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks , and\\nanticipate this to happen next week at the latest .\\nthe company has a 25 % working interest in the syivan lake project .\\nsymbo | - mogi\\ncurrent price - . 26\\nreasons to consider mogi :\\n1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bul |\\nmarket in a generation .\\n2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years .\\n3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on\\nreserves potentialiy worth muiti - millions , mogi is seliing for less\\nthan 1 / 4 the vaiue of its assets .\\n4 . montana oi | and gas specializes in using new technology to turn\\nunproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . aiready\\nshares in the oi | and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa | | market .\\nin fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the\\npast year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized explorers and\\ndeveiopers like montana oi | ( mogi ) that the biggest gains are being\\nmade . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even\\nquadruple returns .\\nbreaking news ! !\\napril 29 , - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its\\nsylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonable weather and\\nroad closures in the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig\\nwas moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m\\nwell . the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in\\ncompliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well\\nimmediately there after .\\nthe company ' s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion\\nof tie in upon lifting of the road ban .\\nwith the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and\\ngas has prepared a detailed project description .\\nproject history\\nthe sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and\\nhas produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil\\nand 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas ,\\npredominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field\\nremains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and\\nexpanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics .\\nthe original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major\\noil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an\\nexploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was\\nabandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely\\neroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company\\ndid no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the\\ncomplaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the\\ndeeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the\\nwest one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in\\nthe early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as\\nmineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more\\nspecifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral\\nrights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil\\nand gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee .\\nthrough diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered\\nthis relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since\\nthat time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres\\n( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 %\\nof this prospect ( possibly 75 % ) with the drilling of a test well in\\n5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m .\\nland discussion\\nour partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and\\nnortheast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480\\nacres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling\\nspacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160\\nacres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the\\nprovince allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units\\n( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s\\nsatisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased\\nwell density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has\\nbeen down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering\\npekisko oil we will down space as well .\\ngeological discussion\\npekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and\\nassociated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the\\nsylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the\\npekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was\\ninfluenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying\\nthis ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the\\nmississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable\\nshales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and\\naccount for billions of barrels of reserves .\\nproduction facilities discussion\\nthis immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas\\nover the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering\\nand processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been\\nconstructed .\\na major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our\\nproject with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed\\ndrilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is\\napproximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly ,\\nexcess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in\\nthe best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible .\\nthis gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the\\ntransportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of\\nred deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get\\noil product to the transportation system .\\nfor more detailed project description please see news release dated\\n( fri , apr 29 ) .\\ngood luck and successfu | trading .\\nconclusion :\\nthe examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known\\ncompanies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ;

makary .\\nplease endeavour to use this for charity .\\ncalvary greetings ! !\\nmy name is mrs . ruth makary a 65 yrs old lady . i am a cancer patient and a\\nnationality of kuwait . i am married to mr . sammy makary who worked with\\nkuwait embassy in switzerland for nine years before he died in an automobile\\ncrash in december 1999 . we were married for eleven years without a child .\\nbefore his death we were devoted christians . when my late husband was alive\\nwe protected our assets of $ usd 5 million through the purchase of a life\\ninsurance policy ( swiss variable annuities ) from a swiss life insurance\\ncompany . i was irrevocably designates as beneficiaries of the policy . the\\npurpose of this investment was to safe our principal capital and make use of\\naccrues income from the annuities for our upkeep since the principal fund\\nand the accrued interest are exempt from swiss taxes under swiss law . but\\nunfortunately he dies .\\nrecently , my doctor told me that i would not last long due to my cancer\\nproblem . though what disturbs me most is my stroke . i developed this\\nsickness as a result of the sudden shock and hearth attack i had when the\\nbreaking news came to me on that faithful day that my husband was involved\\nin an auto crash and died at the spot in the city of zurich in december\\n1999 .\\nhaving known my condition i decided to liquidate these assets and donate\\nthis fund with all the accrued interests to church or better still a\\nchristian individual that will utilize this money the way i am going to\\ninstruct here in . i want an individual that will use this fund to churches ,\\norphanages , research centers and widows , propagating the word of god and to\\nensure that the house of god is maintained .\\ni took this bold decision because i dont have any child that will inherit\\nthis money and my husbands relatives are of questionable characters and are\\nnot christians . and i dont want my hard earned money to be misused by\\nunbelievers and i would dislike a situation where this money will be used in\\nan ungodly manner . hence the reasons for taking this bold decision .\\ni am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going and everyone is\\nentitling to death . i know that i am going to be in the bosom of the lord .\\nexodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my\\npeace . i will be glad to speak with you if i had the privileged to do so .\\nwith god all things are possible .\\ni have briefed our attorney about this development . as soon as i receive\\nyour reply indicating your interest to help me , i shall provide you with the\\ncontacts of our lawyer in edinburgh , uk whom shall help you to process the\\nfreezing of the life policy and have the fund transferred to you . to process\\nthe liquidation of this asset would incur some expenses . please i urge you\\nto take care of this as your contribution towards bringing this vision to a\\nreality for the doing of god own thing . god loves a cheerful giver and i\\npray that he gives you the wisdom to handle this project .\\ni want you and the church to always pray for me . my happiness is that i\\nlived a life of a worthy christian . whoever that wants to serve the lord\\nmust serve him in spirit and truth . please always be prayerful all through\\nyour life . any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for other\\npeople for this same purpose .\\nplease assure me that you will act accordingly as i stated here , and if in\\nanyway you would not be interested , please discard

approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .\\nthe percentage of dia | - up versus broadband users woridwide is even\\nhigher .\\nnomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial -

w\\nbnp petroleum corporation , inc . is an irving based oil and gas\\nexploration and development ( ed ) company . bnp petroleum corporation , inc . was\\nformed for the purpose of development and operation of oil and gas\\nproperties with proven reserves . the company ' s strategy is to focus in\\ndomestic areas where major oil and gas producing companies have reduced\\ntheir exploration efforts to move offshore and overseas in search of the\\nlarger reserves . considerable oil and gas in proven fields remain to be\\nexploited by well - managed independent oil companies capable of\\nextracting these reserves at lower risk and lower cost than unproved prospects .\\nbnp petroleum ' s initial development strategy has been to acquire such\\nproven fields and increase production through the application of\\nadvanced technology and the exploration of other proven formations in the same\\nfields .\\nbnp petroleum corporation ' s primary operational strategy includes the\\noperation of its own projects , giving it substantial control over\\ndrilling and production costs . the company has associated with highly\\nexperienced exploration and development engineering and geology personnel that\\nstrive to add production at lower costs through development drilling ,\\nworkovers , behind pipe recompletions and secondary recovery operations .\\nthe company ' s long - term strategy is to build an oil and gas production\\ncompany through a strategic combination of selected property\\nacquisitions and an exploration program . additionally , the company will

accomplishing modifications and upgrades on\\nsome wells , in the last few months . the shallow wells previously had been\\nproducing oil and water at low rates due to low bottom pressure , which\\nis normal for the area . steadily increasing rates of production for\\nhooks lease are expected .\\nbnp director , rafael pinedo said today , bnp petroleum will begin\\nimmediately to restart other leases in our portfolio of properties and\\ncomplete all necessary work to assure that bnp ' s properties are in full\\ncompliance with the regulations of the texas railroad commission and re

' the caribbean market is one in which our technology has the\\nopportunity to potentially gain market share through our ability to provide voip\\nservices over dial up networks . we are please with the distribution\\nrelationships of lmb technologies inc . and hope to see our products in the\\ncaribbean market commercially in the short term . ! ( , stated jan olivier ,\\nceo and chairman of nomad international inc .\\nmay 18 - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent\\nannouncement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications\\ncommission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol\\n( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone\\nservice .\\nin its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build\\nsustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers\\nwill not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to\\nstifle competition .\\nthe ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter\\nthe canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,\\ncable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the\\nmarket with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad\\ninternational inc .\\nthe key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its\\nproducts to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though\\nbroadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization\\nworldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the\\nu . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the\\ntotal users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only\\napproximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore\\nrepresents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .\\nthe percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even\\nhigher .\\nnomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service\\nproviders not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,\\nbut also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace\\nby offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product .\\nabout nomad international inc .\\nnomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications\\ncompany developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over\\ninternet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip\\nproduct line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl ,\\ncable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on\\ntargeting : 1 ) national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in\\neffectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace ,\\n2 ) large multinational corporations which need to have us or european\\npresence by having , ( for example ) , a united states number ringing in\\ntheir offices in guatemala or london -

year review\\nprocess , we will not share performance clusters with employees when\\nconducting their reviews . it is very important for all of us to be\\nconsistent in this process , so please communicate this to all in your groups\\nwho will be giving performance reviews . it is important to note , however ,\\nthat the content of an employee ' s review should be consistent with our view\\nof that employee ' s relative ranking . in other words , an employee in the\\nsatisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that\\nthe employee is doing a great job . clearly , a large number of employees\\nperformed at a higher level than those employees in the satisfactory\\ncategory , so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas\\nof improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in\\nthe organization , help you achieve the groups goals , etc .\\nalso please note the following :\\nperformance reviews for anyone in the satisfactory , needs improvement or\\nissues categories must be reviewed by hr prior to these reviews being given\\nto the employees . this will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with\\nthe relative performance of that employee . ( this has been the stated process\\nfor the bottom two categories , and we are adding satisfactory to this process\\nas well . )\\nplease remember to include a more experienced member of your management team ,\\nyourself , or an hr professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced\\nmembers of your management team , or those management team members where you\\nhave a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and\\nperhaps tough performance feedback . i believe that we have spent some time\\nin identifying these situations . i ask your help to ensure that we follow\\nthrough on this commitment .\\nthanks for all of your efforts in making this mid -

of stack manager\\nintroduction\\nin response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have\\nupgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we\\nhope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your\\nproducts .\\nthis new release will be automatically installed within the next few days .\\nplease ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade .\\nsummary of new features\\nmultiple children - a \" child \" product can be the \" parent \" of another child\\n( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed\\nagainst a single parent .\\nstatic product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and\\nhit the \" + \" or \" - \" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount\\nin product properties until you logout .\\nsorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on\\nthe title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your \" shift \" key .\\nparent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis\\nrelationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : \" basis\\nlink - parent \" and now would say \" stand alone , parent \" ) .\\ndetailed feature descriptions\\nmultiple children\\nthe new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together\\nin a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product\\nb , which is in turn linked to parent product c .\\nwarning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a\\nchain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a\\ncustomer attempts a transaction , the database must \" lock \" each and every\\nproduct in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the\\ndatabase must then update the stack for each product before releasing the\\nlocks . \" vertical \" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are\\nmuch slower to process than \" flat \" chains ( one parent with many children ) .\\nlarge vertical chains should be avoided .\\nrelated to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the\\nsame parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent\\nproduct b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link\\nto the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated\\nbasis link and a regular basis link .\\nstatic product bar prices\\nthe new version of enrononline provides for \" sticky \" product bar price and\\nvolume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not\\nreset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you\\nhave logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or\\noffsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the \" + \" or \" - \" buttons .\\none of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it\\nreduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if\\nthe price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price\\nmovement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the\\nwebsite to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder\\nfor customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update\\nmoves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering\\nan appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price\\nmovement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary ,\\nimproving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure\\nrate .\\nyou may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field\\nfor offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products\\nwhich have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu .\\nsorting / selecting\\nthe new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting\\nfunctionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type ,\\nlocation , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple\\nsorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then\\nlocation while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first\\nby product type and then within each product type , by location ( in\\nalphabetical order ) .\\nif you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort\\ncriteria , plus you can select \" sort by web order \" , which allows you to see\\nyour products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the\\nwebsite ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a\\nnumber of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) .\\nwhen you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left\\nmouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while\\nmaking your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not\\nnecessarily adjacent to one another .\\nparent products and f / x products\\none of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its\\ntreatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the\\ntype of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of\\nthe main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version\\ndoes not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for\\nmore than one type of link on each parent product .\\nsome traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now\\nidentified with a stylised \" fx \" in the product list . this is to enable easy\\nidentification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the\\nparent , rather than managed individually .\\nassistance\\nas always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality ,\\nplease contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 )\\n20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) .\\ngeneral feedback\\nif you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further\\nfunctionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had\\npreviously suggested new functionality which didn \\' t make it into this\\nrelease , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard\\nto improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your\\nrequests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .', 0), (\"Subject: kingwood cove - $ 10 before 10 am !\\nonly $ 10 for a 1 / 2 cart & green fee !\\nwednesday & friday mornings before 10 am .\\nprint out and present this email offer the day of play .\\nnot valid with any other offers .\\nthanks for being a part of our e -

tobacco\\nwhen he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government\\nsubsidies .\\n3 . gorons truly believe that gore is a vietnam war hero , when in fact\\nhe was placed by family influence in a \" cushy \" correspondent \\' s job and\\nthe only action he saw was that of his brownie camera ! ( and his bong )\\n4 . gorons actually believe that mr . gore is justified in illegally\\nraising political funds from the office of the vp , simply because the\\nvanderbilt law educated vp claims he was ignorant of the illegality .\\n5 . gorons further believe that it was ok for al to accept large sums\\nof political money from china through buddhist monks who had taken vows\\nof poverty , since he again claimed ignorance .\\n6 . gorons also believe that the man who claimed to \" invent the\\ninternet \" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks\\nof potentially incriminating e - mail !\\n7 . gorons , incredibly , believe gore \\' s claim that he and tipper were\\nthe models for the book and movie , \" love story \" even though the book \\' s\\nauthor , erich segal , says not .\\n8 . gorons , amazingly , believe that gore will be the consumer \\' s\\nchampion against high gasoline prices although gore holds a million\\ndollars in occidental petroleum stock .\\n9 . gorons applaud mr . lieberman \\' s open rejection of president\\nclinton \\' s immorality , but believe it was fine for mr . gore to remain\\nsilent on the subject , while simultaneously declaring mr . clinton \" one of\\nthe greatest presidents of our history . \"\\n10 . gorons believe that al gore is an effective leader , when they\\nwon \\' t bother to look at his record as a tennessee senator , a record so\\nineffective that it has led to the election of republicans as both of\\ntennessee \\' s senators !\\n11 . gorons hold the belief that gore is a compassionate man who

whether the wellheads are producing or not .\\nproducing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts\\nhedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .\\nonce that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads\\nwere allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will\\nprobably have to go back to hplc \\' s ownership of hplr \\' s gathering assets .\\nnon - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells\\nbehind it have been shut - in , or p & a \\' d , we will need to reallocate this deal\\nto zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another\\ndeal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced\\ncontracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result\\nin a financial loss ) .\\nin either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow\\nat meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon\\nas i ascertain that date .\\nin lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals\\nwhich were impacted by hplc \\' s aquisition of hplr \\' s gathering to ensure that\\nthey are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing\\nlevel . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to

(\"Subject: cleco deals 449243 & 397957 / state tract 121 ( meter 785 )\\nfred or anita ,\\ni just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same\\npage . from my understanding , the allocation for meter 785 : state tract 121\\nis supplied from bryancy braumley . prior to 09 / 1 / 00 bryancy would calculate\\nflow from certain wellheads , total this volume , and then send us an\\nallocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land\\nand hpl ( sale from cleco ) at meter 785 . effective 09 / 1 / 00 a compressor was\\nput in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor , as well as the\\ngas from meter 9662 ( deal 137595 sales from dewbre ) , and is now measured at\\nmeter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meter\\nstatement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 ' s flow . once this is done ,\\nshe can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land\\nand hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now a\\ncheck meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter .\\nfor 9 / 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco , deal 397957\\nand 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifer\\nmartinez , i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use\\n449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroed\\nout the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal\\n449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal\\n449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generate\\nfor 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . the\\nallocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure that\\nbryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl\\n( cleco ) . i have spoke to her , as well as jennifer martinez , and curtis\\nfunderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences .\\nin addition , i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a\\ncallout \\\\ swing effect 9 / 00 . for october and succeeding months , the volume\\nshould be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . then\\nbyancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land\\nand hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and\\nthe hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas general\\nland nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on\\nthat yet .\\nplease let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or\\nyou need something more done on my end . also , let me know who is going to be\\ndoing this monthly allocation . it might be beneficial to have one person\\ndoing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !\", 0), ('Subject: revision # 1 - hpl noms for november 3

issue at teco ' s indian spring plant . exxon ' s issue is that\\nthe residue volumes that hpl is recording for exxon ' s account for\\ntransportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to\\npge .\\nitems that were identified so that exxon ' s issue could be resolved :\\n1 . hpl is responsible for any ua 4 loss / gain and fuel consumed on pge ' s line\\nattributable to exxon ' s big sandy production .\\n2 . if exxon ' s production exceeds 500 mcf / d , hpl must on a monthly basis\\nelect to process or not process the exxon big sandy gas . if hpl elects\\nto process , then teco buys the products from hpl .\\n3 . if exxon ' s production flows between 100 mcf / d and 499 mcf / d , then teco\\ncan process and makeup the shrinkage to hpl with their own gas volumes .\\n4 . if exxon ' s production is less than 100 mcf / d , then hpl must terminate\\nthe processing agreement . if hpl does not terminate and volume continue\\nto flow at less that 100 mcf / d than hpl loses the shrinkage and must\\npay to teco an additional $ 500 per month .\\nsolution :\\n1 . hpl will schedule and record the gain / loss volumes at hpl meter # 986884\\nthat is attributable to ua 4 and fuel on the pge line .\\n2 . hpl will schedule and record the sale volumes of pvr to teco at hpl\\nmeter # 986884 .\\n3 . the scheduling of the volumes for items 1 and 2 will allow for offset\\nvolumes to be record as adjustments to exxon ' s transport volumes .\\n4 . the hpl logistics dept . ( mary poorman ) will inform assets group ( jack\\nsimunek ) when and if the volumes nominated for exxon fall below 100 mcf / d .\\nif any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to , please\\nlet me know at x - 36650 .\\nthanks , clem\", 0)]\n"

music notation / representation standard integrated with multimedia . the\\naim of this workshop is to make a further step to arrive at standardizing a music\\nnotation / representation model and decoder integrated into the mpeg environment ,\\nthat presently can be regarded as the most active and powerful set of standard\\nformats for multimedia consumers .\\nthe topics of the workshop are

irish citizen and a successful farmer in our remote village . my father served him for many years and inherited his farm after his death . my father became an executive member of the farmers association in the western mashonaland province of zimbabwe . he also became a successful businessman , because of the recent uprising in my country and the war veterans and farmers clashing , my father decided that it would be safer if my younger brother and i move to south africa to escape the violence .\\nwe left zimbabwe with two boxes containing the sum of us $ 11 . 5 m ( eleven million , five hundred thousand united states dollars only ) and valuables ( diamonds ) worth us $ 5 m . my father has instructed us to deposit it with a private security company on our arrival .\\nhe also instructed me not to reveal the contents of the box to anyone for security reasons and all the documents pertaining to this deposition .\\nbarely two months after we moved to johannesburg , we got information that my father ' s farm had been invaded and that my parent and most of his workers had been killed . my father ' s property and farmland have now been taken over by the war veterans .\\ni believe that this has been the work of people who did not like my father because of white owned farms . we could not even attend the funerals of my parents as we also now fear for our dear lives . our reason for contacting you is to seek for your assistance in providing an overseas bank account where we can transfer this fund . have in mind that this is a risk free business as we have conclude a modality for the transfer . your participation gives you 20 % of the total sum , 7 % for all expense in curred during this business while 73 % is for my younger brother and i . the diamond will be discussed at our arrival .\\nwe do not know much about diamonds or how to invest this money so we will also need your assistance in this regard . we have agreed to give you a share of the money if you are willing to assit us , should this proposal meet your utmost consideration , please do not hesitate to contact my brother or me on the above email address .\\nthe confidentiality of this proposal cannot be overemphasized as we believe that you will oblige with us the needed security and attention it demands . please treat this proposal with the utmost regard , and the confidentiality of these

immediately !\\nsales orders received by leth exceed $ 150 million over the past year\\nwhile major news was just released that adds multi - millions to the bottom\\nline . leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating\\nheavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come\\nfor this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into\\nelectrical energy , an industry with such high global demand that it is\\nimpossible to assign a value to the size of the market .\\n( mar 9 ' 04 ) urgent news update :\\nleth announces the sale of two ( 2 ) biosphere process systems to\\nprocura international limited for $ 14 million with an option for the sale of\\nan additional 98 systems over the next 24 months .\\nsolving a dual crisis - waste and energy :\\nleth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere\\nprocess system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of\\nwaste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the\\nglobal waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process\\nconverts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal\\nsolid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial\\nwastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of\\nused tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste\\nconversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour\\nof electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid .\\n( mar 3 ' 04 ) leth release major product delivery and net profit news\\nleth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit\\nof $ 3 . 5 million , the equivalent of . 12 cents per share . leth is scheduled to\\nreceive an additional $ 7 million translating into an additional . 24 cents per\\nshare which is the balance of this completed contract over

( nasdaq : ttek , $ 20 ) a\\nleader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical , and\\nelectrical management consulting services primarily for the us government\\nwith annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will coordinate the securing of\\nnecessary permits , installation , and continuous worldwide monitoring of the\\nbiosphere process system for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of\\nobtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the\\nbiosphere process in the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for\\nleth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana\\nwhile having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near -\\nterm announcement .\\nstock set to explode on earnings boom :\\nleth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to\\nachieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company ' s\\nbreakout year . the added kicker is that leth has historically released\\nbatches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully\\ncompleted sales contracts early in the calendar year . we feel that pattern is\\nrepeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very\\nbig surprises still to come . there aren ' t any companies at any price level\\nwith the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth ,

watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to\\nreplenish the local or national grid .\\nthe biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need\\nfor cost - effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding\\nuniversal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste .\\nleth has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product\\ndesigned to significantly impact the global waste problem while a\\nmajor push for generating electricity from alternative sources\\ncontinues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power\\nfailures .\\nfinancing of $ 250 million positions leth for astronomical sales :\\nthe magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the\\nfact that this $ 1 . 50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to\\n$ 8 . 62 per common share in cash . there are 26 biosphere process\\nsystems presently in operation worldwide . the available funding\\ncould easily be used to produce 100 additional biospheres . now factor\\nin that the average sale price is $ 7 million per biosphere . we\\ncannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with\\na potential $ 700 , 000 , 000 in future sales with 29 million shares\\noutstanding !\\nleth stock guidance :\\ncurrent price : 1 . 80\\nnear -

speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian\\nadministration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the\\nfederal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family\\nbecause of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late\\nhusband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have\\nresolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including\\nproperties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the\\nvarious bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact ,\\nthe attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of\\nseizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our\\nfamily in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband .\\nin view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our\\nfamily trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has\\ncalled me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the\\ndemurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very\\nsoon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas\\namount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come\\nto my full assistance and unlimited\\nco - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole\\nfamily members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living\\non goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the\\nsins\\nof my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy\\nand kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my\\nchildren from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will\\ncompensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of\\nthe total amount of $ 20 million us dollars .\\nin that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your\\ndiscrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in\\nyour favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur\\n( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by\\nyou . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my\\nchildren ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with\\nthe trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe\\noperation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance\\ncompany where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide\\nowner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through\\ndr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com and\\nphone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal .\\ni look forward to your quick response while thanking\\nyou for your co - operation . in view of all above\\ndetails , i request you to keep this letter and\\nco - operation highly confidential .\\nbest wishes ,\\nmrs . mariam abacha .\\n\", 1), ('Subject: stop paying for your pay per view channels , fri , 30 apr 2004 16 : 50 : 29 + 0500\\nfri , 30 apr 2004 07 : 54 : 29 -

to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . the purpose of my mail is that i am mr . peter stevens , the second son of dr . dennis stevens , who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i am writing from holland ( the netherlands ) where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker .\\nbefore the death of my father , he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of ( us $ 18 . 9 m ) eighteen million , nine hundred thousand united states dollars only , in a private security and finance company . may be he for - saw the looming danger in zimbabwe ? but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company . this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland .\\nthe land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe , introduced a new land use decree / act that , affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks . this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society , so to say . infact , a lot of people were killed in this land reform act , including my father .\\nit is against this back - ground , that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands , forbids a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to have such a money in an account . i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because ; i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers .\\ni must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide . this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice .\\ni have two options of offers for your assistance . you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon , or you may decide to have 20 % of the total sum , 70 % will be for me and my family and the remaining 10 % will be set aside for un - forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end .\\nyou may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is , about this proposal . please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction .\\nthank for your

definitive answers for people , i wanted to post my personal review\\nof the two systems .\\ni have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit ,\\nboth with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via\\nan ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca\\nadapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and\\nsirius for a few months in the pacific northwest .\\nthe bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in\\nsound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel\\nquality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more\\nchannels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) .\\nafter careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have\\nsaid . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and\\nare streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its\\noft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm\\nhas an extra comedy channel ( it \\' s boring , and features older , censored\\ncomedy ) , and a few more \" experimental \" music channels which most will find\\ntotally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular\\n( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it \\' s\\nno wonder xm doesn \\' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you\\nbuy . also , xm \\' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion .\\nthe greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are\\nthe staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the\\ncorporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying\\nin an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that\\nmakes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you \\' ve had it up\\nloud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) .\\nthis , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my\\ncancelling xm .\\nxm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent\\nmusic and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept\\nxm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no\\nmatter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered\\neverything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the\\ntalk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the\\nuseful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan .\\nxm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius\\nalso has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) .\\nhowever , xm doesn \\' t have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all\\nhave to pay xm $ 6 . 99 extra in additon to buying another $ 200 receiver for\\nthe house . in addition to the crappy commercials , this is probably where\\nthe corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows .', 1), (\"Subject: no ,

this letter as a request from a family in dare need of assistance .\\nlet me formally introduce myself . i am duve khumalo , the son of late . dr . robinson khumalo , the renowned zimbabwean wine and cattle ranch farmer .\\ni got your contact courtesy of a business journal from the south african information exchange in my earnest search for a reliable and trustworthy individual / company who can assist me in this business .\\nduring the war waged against the farmers in zimbabwe by the supporters and cohorts of president robert mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country , my late father belonged to one of the classes of farmers targeted by the zanu - pf armed group , because he did not support their ideas and policies .\\nin the course of the revolution in the country , the zanu - pf armed group attacked and invaded my father ' s farms burning , destroying and eventually killing him . after my father ' s death last year , i managed to escape the boundaries of zimbabwe into south africa with my mother , because our lives were threatened and zimbabwe was no longer safe for us .\\nwe escaped safely into south africa with my father ' s lifetime fortune of us $ 25 ( twenty five million\\nus dollars ) cash , bonds , important documents of property title and other valuables , which he instructed i his son on before his death . the money and valuables were concealed and secured in two treasure boxes , and were transported to netherlands through diplomatic means .\\nthe boxes are currently safely secured in the vaults of a private security and brokerage firm there in netherlands .\\npresently , i am residing temporarily with my mother in johannesburg pending the outcome of an appeal filed on my behalf by my attorney for the department of home affairs to grant us political asylum .\\nat the moment , i am in a dilemma on how to move this money safely out of netherlands for investments . moreover , due to netherlands government ' s stringent monetary policies / regulations and the sensitive and volatile political status of the region , it would be most dangerous to attempt investments there as such act could jeopardize our chances .\\nin recognition of your personal executive powers and investment opportunities that abound in your country , i solicit for your assistance in moving this money into your bank account for safekeeping pending our future arrival for investments .\\nmy mother and i have resolved to compensate you adequately by offering a brokerage commission of 20 % of the money .\\nwe have also earmarked 5 % for pre - transfer expenses we may incur in the course of the transaction and guarantee that any other expenses during the transaction are subject to refund .\\ni have in mind to establish a good business and friendly relationship with you in the nearest future if you are able to assist us .\\nplease let me receive your approval or reply through this my email address ( khumaduvel 01 @ netscape . net ) or phone number above and feel free to ask any questions you may consider relevant and kindly , send your phone and fax number for easier communication .\\nif you are unable to assist please be kind to notify

based platform for\\ntransactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the\\nsite . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell\\nat the posted price . this converts a \\x01 & bulletin board \\x01 8 ( the more typical\\necommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,\\ncompetitors that can provide this capability .\\nwe are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be\\ndramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are\\ncorrect , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .\\naccordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this\\nopportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net\\nworks , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a\\nbroad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately\\nbe our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike\\nmcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial\\nofficer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for\\nenron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .\\nreplacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron\\nnorth america is dave delainey , who will also join enron \\x01 , s executive\\ncommittee .\\nglobal technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net\\nworks . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as\\nan enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology\\nofficer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the\\ndevelopment of worldwide technology standards and platforms .\\nenrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now\\nbe a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to\\nutilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the\\nfollowing individuals are included in enron net works along with their\\ncurrent ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay\\nfitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,\\npulp and paper .\\nover the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational\\ndesign and will provide full details on this exciting new business\\nopportunity .', 0), (\"Subject: re : equistar deal tickets\\nhere is the information you requested .\\n- -
